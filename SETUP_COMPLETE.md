# 🎉 GitHub Pages Setup Complete!

## ✅ What Has Been Done

Your Park INC website is now ready to be published on GitHub Pages! Here's what was configured:

### 1. Vite Configuration Update
- Modified `frontend/vite.config.js` to add the base path `/IND8137A/`
- This ensures all assets (CSS, JavaScript, images) load correctly on GitHub Pages

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow Created
- Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Automatically builds and deploys your site when you push to the `main` branch
- Can also be triggered manually from the Actions tab

### 3. Documentation Added
- Created `GITHUB_PAGES.md` with comprehensive deployment guide
- Updated `README.md` with live demo link and deployment section

### 4. Testing Completed
- Successfully tested local build
- Verified all assets use correct paths
- No security vulnerabilities detected
- Code review passed with no issues

## 📋 Next Steps (Required)

To complete the GitHub Pages deployment, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Merge This Pull Request
1. Review the changes in this PR
2. Merge the PR into the `main` branch

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/Niang-04/IND8137A
2. Click on **Settings** (top right)
3. In the left sidebar, click **Pages**
4. Under **Build and deployment**:
   - **Source**: Select "**GitHub Actions**" (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
5. Save the settings

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment
- The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically start
- You can monitor progress in the **Actions** tab
- It takes about 1-2 minutes to complete

### Step 4: Access Your Site! 🎊
Your site will be live at:
```
https://niang-04.github.io/IND8137A/
```

## 🔄 How Automatic Deployment Works

From now on:
- Every time you push to the `main` branch, the site will automatically rebuild and redeploy
- You can also manually trigger a deployment from the Actions tab
- No manual build or upload steps needed!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### About the Backend
GitHub Pages only hosts **static files** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). The backend API (`backend/server.js`) is **not included** in this deployment.

For the full application to work, you have two options:

#### Option A: Deploy Backend Separately (Recommended)
Deploy your backend to a service like:
- **Heroku** (free tier available)
- **Render** (free tier available)
- **Railway** (free tier available)
- **Fly.io** (free tier available)

Then update the frontend to use the deployed backend URL.

#### Option B: Use Mock Data (For Demo)
The frontend can work standalone with simulated data for demonstration purposes.

## 📁 Files Changed

```
✅ .github/workflows/deploy.yml   (new) - Automated deployment workflow
✅ GITHUB_PAGES.md                (new) - Deployment documentation
✅ frontend/vite.config.js        (modified) - Added base path
✅ README.md                      (modified) - Added live demo link
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If the site doesn't load:
1. Check that GitHub Pages is set to "GitHub Actions" in Settings → Pages
2. Verify the workflow completed successfully in the Actions tab
3. Wait a few minutes for DNS to propagate

### If you see 404 errors:
1. Make sure the PR was merged to `main` branch
2. Check that the workflow ran successfully
3. Verify the base path in `vite.config.js` is `/IND8137A/`

### If API calls fail:
- This is expected! The backend is not deployed with GitHub Pages
- Deploy the backend separately or use mock data
